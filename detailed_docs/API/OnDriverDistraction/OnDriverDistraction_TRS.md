## Functional requirements

1. 
Driver distraction rules (if active) are expected to be configurable on HMI for each platform.  
HMI must inform SDL via OnDriverDistraction whenever the driver distraction mode is activated/deactivated on HMI.  

Important Note: DD rules are not applicable to SDL functionality, but describes platform (head unit) configuration and driver distraction restrictions to display or operate some functionality on HMI.  
Driver distraction rules may be specific to contry/area, so it depends on HMI when to trigger activate/deactivate states.

For current HMI configuration, sub-menu opening and and ScrollableMessage operating are not available duringh DD ON mode. HMI may notify user about DD mode enabling-disabling.

2. 
In case  
HMI notifies SDL about current DriverDistraction mode ON/OFF via OnDriverDistraction notification  

SDL must  

transfer OnDriverDistraction(`<state>`) notification to all applications being registered to SDL running in any HMI Level except NONE

_Information:_
_Whether the app receives the notification in current HMILevel is defined by app's assigned Policies._

3.  
In case
mobile app registers and gets NONE HMI Level
and SDL receives OnDriverDistraction (`<state>`) fom HMI

SDL must  

transfer the last known (actual) OnDriverDistraction (`<state>`) to this mobile app right after this mobile app changes HMILevel to any other than NONE

4. 
In case 
HMI sends OnDriverDistraction (ON) to SDL 
and mobile app successfully connects on SDL and gets any HMI Level except NONE

SDL must  

transfer OnDriverDistraction (ON) to this connected app 

5.  
In case  
HMI sends invalid notification that SDL should transfer to mobile app  

SDL must 

log the issue and ignore this notification

Information:  
Invalid notifications means the notification contains:  
a. params out of bounds or incorrect symbols (/t, /n, `<whitespace>`)  
b. mandatory params are missing  
c. params of wrong type  
d. invalid json  
e. incorrect combination of params

6. 
In case  
HMI sends valid, allowed by policies OnDriverDistraction notification with all mandatory fields to SDL  
and in Policies `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param is set as `true`

SDL must  
transfer OnDriverDistraction notification with `lockScreenDismissalEnabled=true` to mobile app

7.  
In case  
HMI sends valid, allowed by policies OnDriverDistraction notification with all mandatory fields to SDL  
and in Policies `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param is set as `false`

SDL must  
transfer OnDriverDistraction notification without `lockScreenDismissalEnabled=false` to mobile app

8.  
In case  
HMI sends valid, allowed by policies OnDriverDistraction notification with all mandatory fields to SDL  
and `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param is omitted in Policies  

SDL must  
transfer OnDriverDistraction notification without `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param to mobile app

9.  
In case  
in Policies `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param is missed   
and after PTU `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param's value was updated  
and HMI sends valid, allowed by policies OnDriverDistraction notification with all mandatory fields to SDL

SDL must  
transfer OnDriverDistraction notification with updated value of `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` param to mobile app

## Non-functional requirements
1. New `lockScreenDismissalEnabled` parameter must be added to Mobile_API

```
    <function name="OnDriverDistraction" functionID="OnDriverDistractionID" messagetype="notification" since="1.0">
        <description>Provides driver distraction state to mobile applications</description>
        <param name="state" type="DriverDistractionState" mandatory="true">
            <description>Current State of Driver Distraction</description>
        </param>
    </function>
    <!-- newly added parameter -->
    <param name="lockScreenDismissalEnabled" type="Boolean" mandatory="false">
    <description>
      If enabled, the lock screen will be able to be dismissed while connected to SDL, allowing users 
      the ability to interact with the app. Dismissals should include a warning to the user and ensure 
      that they are not the driver.
    </description>
  </param>
 ```  
 
2. HMI_API
```
  <function name="OnDriverDistraction" messagetype="notification">
    <description>Notification must be sent from HMI to SDL when driver distraction state is changed. Driver distraction rules are defined by the platform.</description>
    <param name="state" type="Common.DriverDistractionState" mandatory="true">
      <description>See DriverDistractionState. </description>
    </param>
  </function>
``` 
3. PolicyTable must support new `lock_screen_dismissal_enabled` parameter set by default as 'true' to module_config section of PT.
```
{
    "policy_table": {
        "module_config": {
            "preloaded_pt": true,
            "exchange_after_x_ignition_cycles": 100,
            "exchange_after_x_kilometers": 1800,
            "exchange_after_x_days": 30,
            "timeout_after_x_seconds": 60,
            "seconds_between_retries": [1,
            5,
            25,
            125,
            625],
            "lock_screen_dismissal_enabled": true
  ```
